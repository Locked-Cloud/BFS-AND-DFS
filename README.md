# Graph Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental graph traversal algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) in Python. 

## Algorithms

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to nodes at the next depth level.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores each branch as deep as possible before backtracking.

## Files

- `graph.py`: Contains the Graph class with BFS and DFS methods.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates usage of BFS and DFS.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run `main.py` to see the algorithms in action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph_search_algorithms.git
cd graph_search_algorithms
python main.py
